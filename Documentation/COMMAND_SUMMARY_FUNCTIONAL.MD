## Working with Application Submissions

### Complete-ApplicationSubmission
**Alias:** Commit-ApplicationSubmission

Commits the specified application submission so that it can start the approval process.

Once committed, it is necessary to wait for the submission to either complete or fail the approval process before a new application submission can be created/submitted.

Note: This completes the submission API transaction, but not necessarily the publication
of the submission. The decision whether to publish after successful certification depends
on the TargetPublishMode setting when the submission was created.

Wraps the [Commit An App Submission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/monetize/commit-an-app-submission) Microsoft Store Submission API.

**Required inputs:**
- AppId

Dev Portal in order for this function to work. The submission that is returned is
a clone of the currently-published submission.

You cannot submit a new application submission if there is an existing pending
application submission for $AppId already.  You can use -Force to work around this.

The .appxbundle, .appxupload, and .appx files are given via the -AppxPath parameter.
    
In the process of creating the JSON, the packaging tool also copies any specified
images and .appx files to a .zip file.
    
The .json and .zip files generated by this tool are given the common name specified by the -OutName parameter.

**Required inputs:** ConfigPath (existing SBConfig.json file)

### Remove-ApplicationSubmission

### Set-ApplicationSubmission
**Alias:** Replace-ApplicationSubmission

Replaces the content of an existing application submission with the supplied submission content.

This should be called after having cloned an application submission via New-ApplicationSubmission.
